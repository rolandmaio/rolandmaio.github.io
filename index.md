Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student at [Columbia University][Columbia]. I study
[Computer Science][Wikipedia CS] focusing on fair machine learning.

I help teach a high school AP Computer Science class at the [Morris Academy for
Collaborative Studies][MACS] as part of the [TEALS program][TEALS]. Shout out
to Mr. Lo (our professional teacher), Mr. Povlitz (co-volunteer) and to all of
our students!
