Hi! I'm a third-year PhD student in [Computer Science][Wikipedia CS] at
[Columbia University][Columbia] advised by [Augustin Chaintreau][Augustin]. My
overarching career goal is to help society harness the power of computing to
its benefit.

Toward that end, in my scientific work I focus on the algorithmic and
machine intelligence properties of the strategic, economic, and
information aggregation aspects of large-scale sociotechnical systems
contextualized within the non-computational dynamics at play.
This intellectual focus implicates a wide range of areas including: fair,
adversarial, and just-plain machine learning, data science, artificial
intelligence, algorithmic fairness, ethics, mechanism design, game theory,
economics, social networks, and antitrust and consumer protection law.

Of equal importance to me is my work as a Computer Science (CS) educator.
Together with the amazing [Tim Randolph][Tim], I am one of the two PhD Student
Coordinators for Columbia's [Emerging Scholars Program][ESP].
