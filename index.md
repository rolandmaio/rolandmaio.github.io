Hi! I'm a third-year PhD student in [Computer Science][Wikipedia CS] at
[Columbia University][Columbia] advised by [Augustin Chaintreau][Augustin]. My
overarching career goal is to help society harness the power of computing to
its benefit.

Toward that end, in my scientific work I focus on the *algorithmic* and
*machine intelligence* properties of the *strategic*, *economic*, and
*information aggregation* aspects of *large-scale sociotechnical systems*.
This intellectual focus implicates a wide range of areas including: fair,
adversarial, and just-plain machine learning, data science, artificial
intelligence, algorithmic fairness, mechanism design, game theory, economics,
social networks, and antitrust and consumer protection law.

Of equal importance to me is my work as a Computer Science (CS) educator.
Together with the amazing [Tim Randolph][Tim], I am one of the two PhD Student
Coordinators for Columbia's [Emerging Scholars Program][ESP].

I enjoy mentoring students at all levels of their career, a holdover from my
previous life as an NCO in the United States Marine Corps. If you are a student
and would like to ask me anything about CS+Society, the PhD, academia, my work
and such. I encourage you to reach out. Due to previous interest, I have put
together a page of resources for students that may be considering pursuing a
PhD in fair machine learning.
