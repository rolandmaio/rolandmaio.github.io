Hi! I'm a student at the [City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu).
I study [Computer Science](Wikipedia CS). I hope to pursue a PhD starting in
the Fall of 2018.

I help teach a high school AP Computer Science class at the [Morris Academy for
Collaborative Studies](MACS) as part of the [TEALS program](TEALS). Shout out
to Mr. Lo (our professional teacher), Mr. Woodruff (co-volunteer) and to all of
our students!

# Research Interests

I am interested in **everything**. But if I have to choose, then I would say
that my research interests are in the <code>interfaces</code> between <span
style="color: red;">computing</span> and <span style="color:
blue;">society</span> and how the <span style="color: red;">former</span> can
be used to most benefit the <span style="color: blue;">latter</span> with an
emphasis on how to do so with artificial intelligence (AI) sytems.

I believe that much future advancement towards these goals will be in the form
of developing the theory, systems, and empirical knowledge that synthesize the
complementary intelligences of humans and machines. This motivates my interests
in interactive machine learning, machine learning explanation, visualization,
and crowdsourcing. The works of Emma Brunskill, Michael Bernstein, Eugene Wu,
and Lydia Chilton provide exciting examples of efforts in these directions.

<!--
Part of such a push will be research that better maps the contours of machine
intelligence in application. I prefer the term machine intelligence to
artificial intelligence to emphasize that machine intelligence is different in
kind, and not necessarily an artificial *imitation* of human intelligence.
Algorithms have been loosed upon society with a mixed bag of results.
Human-comparable&mdash;and even superhuman in some instances&mdash;performance
in detecting cancers in digital images provide exciting examples of the
potential benefits of machine intelligence.

But machine intelligence has also been injected into several stages of the
criminal justice pipeline, from police departments scheduling patrols
(predictive policing) to judges basing sentencing decisions on automated risk
assessments (recidivism prediction). Some of these systems have been
demonstrated to make biased predictions based on race and socio-economic
status.

Such examples beg fascinating research questions: What lessons can we learn
from these applications? How can we enhance the positive impact of applications
like cancer detection? How can we ameliorate bias in applications like
recidivism prediction?
